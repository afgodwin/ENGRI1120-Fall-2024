# Chemical Reaction Kinetics and Equlibrium

## Summary
Chemical reactions are at the center of chemical engineering. The ability to transform molecular reaction events into valuable products is the defining component of the discipline. Chemical reactions are everywhere, from traditional processes, such as the manufacturing of plastics, to biological applications, such as the manufacturing of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. 

There are two ways to think about and model reactions. First, we can consider how the reaction rate changes over time; this time-based perspective relies on the formulation of [kinetic rate laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_equation) and the solution of time-dependent balance equations. Rate laws are mathematical models that describe how the reaction rate changes as a function of the conditions in the reactor, e.g., as a function of the temperature and the composition of the reaction mixture. However, kinetics is not the only way to think about reactions. Instead, we can think about reaction events from the perspective of energy. In this perspective, we can calculate the equilibrium (or steady-state in an open system) reaction extent that minimizes the systemâ€™s energy. This perspective can also tell us if a reaction can occur and whether it is reversible or only proceeds in one direction. 

To understand both of these perspectives, in this unit, we will introduce the following:
* [The theory and application of chemical reaction kinetics](./chemical-kinetics.md)
* [The theory and application of chemical reaction equilibrium](./chemical-equilibrium.md)
* [The theory and application of Flux Balance Anlaysis](./flux-balance-analysis.md)

# Systems, Surroundings and Stuff Balances

## Summary
Chemical Engineers use balance equations to describe, design, and troubleshoot products 
and processes. Balance equations describe the amount of _stuff_ (e.g., mass, the concentration of a particular chemical component, energy, etc.) in a _system_ that interacts with its _surroundings_.
Systems can be physical things like tanks or chemical reactors, or they can also be logical items such as a savings
account or a stage in a multistage decision process. 
_Stuff_ can also be a physical thing such as energy or the
mass of a material or a non-physical quantity such as information or financial value. Regardless of
what the _systems_ and _stuff_ are, the basic form of the balance equation remains the same. 
Thus, if we learn that basic form, we can describe, simulate or design all the products and processes, we are interested in.  

At the end of this lecture module, students will be able to:
* Describe the terms that appear in discrete and continuous _stuff_ balance equations
* Write discrete and continuous balances for a system to arbitrary _stuff_ balance equations

## Introduction
Suppose we take a process, for example, the production of a critical component in a next-generation battery, a biofuel, or an mRNA vaccine, and we break it apart into a system and its surroundings (which is called a universe).
In this example scenario, the system can be a physical thing, e.g., a chemical reactor, turbine, pump, or downstream separation unit such as a distillation column that can exchange mass and energy with its surroundings. 
However, a system can also be logical, e.g., the value of an investment or an opinion about a future price of a 
commodity. When considering a logical system, we are not exchanging mass or energy with the surroundings but instead are 
transferring perhaps money, contracts, or information. Regardless of its actual makeup, the properties of a 
system and its surroundings can be described using balance equations. 
Balance equations have their roots in physical conservation principles, such as the conservation of 
mass, momentum, energy, and number are at the center of Chemical Engineering.

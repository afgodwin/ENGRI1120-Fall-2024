# Objectives, Polices and Resources

## Course objectives 

This course will introduce what chemical engineering is, what chemical engineers do and where the field is evolving in the future. Our central topic will be the design and analysis of processes and products that involve a chemical change within contemporary chemical and biomolecular engineering. 

Toward this topic, students will learn strategies and tools for process design and product development, including mathematical modeling, statistical modeling, numerical methods, and optimization approaches. 

Using these tools, students will analyze and simulate the process and product designs to assess their performance, economic viability, safety, and environmental impact.

## Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. 

## Grading 

Your ENGRI 1120 grade will be computed from 2 x prelim exams (dates/times indicated on the course calendar), a final group project (scheduled by the University), and participation in course activities and calculation sessions.

Each prelim is worth 25% of your final grade. The group project is worth 35% of your grade. Class participation, calculation session attendance, problem set attempts, and other designated participation opportunities will collectively account for 15% of your grade. 

### Problem sets and participation
This course will have optional weekly problem sets, which will be discussed in the discussion section(s) each week. Thus, while problem sets are optional (unless specified otherwise), we expect everyone to attempt every problem and to participate in the discussion section:

* The teaching team reserves the right to collect entire problem sets or specific questions of problem sets throughout the course. 

* Group work is welcome (and encouraged) on problem sets and course projects, but the prelim exams must be completed individually. 

## Course policies 
Scientists and engineers are responsible for maintaining a very high degree of professional integrity in their work. As a student, this means strictly adhering to the Cornell Code of Academic Integrity and the specific policies detailed in your courses.  Please review Cornell’s academic integrity policy if you are not already familiar with it. 

For this course, the specific rules are as follows:

* Cooperation: You may discuss/complete problem sets with classmates, but all submitted work (should there be any) must be your own. Prelims must be completed individually without the help of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and other sources. 

* Submissions: all required submissions (should there be any) must be submitted to the teaching team email: [course email goes here]. Each submission should include your name(s) or netID(s) on the first page of the assignment. Except for computer code, submissions should consist of a single PDF document generated using LaTeX. 

* Re-grade requests: Prelim re-grade requests must be submitted in writing within two weeks of their return. The entire prelim will be re-graded in addition to addressing any requested issues. 

* Computing: The course will officially support numerical computing in the Julia programming language. You can use other numerical computing tools (e.g., Matlab/Octave, Python/NumPy), but support will be limited to Julia. Julia is free and can be downloaded from: https://julialang.org.

* For any computing assignments, you may be required to publish code to GitHub or submit files to Gradescope; in these cases, specific instructions and procedures will be given.  

### Disabilities Statement
If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, provide Prof. Varner with an accommodation letter from Student Disability Services. Students are expected to give two weeks’ notice of the need for accommodations.

### Diversity Statement
We aspire to create an environment for learning, intellectual discourse, and professional and social interactions where every individual feels welcome and valued. We recognize all course participants as responsible adults with differing perspectives based, in part, on their unique experiences. We espouse the broader mission and values of the Smith School as described here: https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/cbe/about/mission.

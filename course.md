# Course policies and procedures

## Description
ENGRI 1120 will introduce what chemical engineering is, what chemical engineers do, and where the field is evolving in the future. Our central topic will be the design and analysis of processes and products that involve a chemical change within contemporary chemical engineering. Students will learn strategies and tools for process design and product development, including mathematical modeling, statistical modeling, numerical methods, and optimization approaches. Using these tools, students will analyze and simulate the process and product designs to assess their performance, economic viability, safety, and environmental impact.

By the end of this course, students will be able to answer: is chemical engineering for me? More broadly, upon completion of this course, students will be able to (ABET student outcomes) :

* __O1__: Identity, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
* __O2__: Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
* __O3__: Communicate effectively with a range of audiences
* __O4__: Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed
judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts
* __O5__: Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives

### Time, place and website
* __Credits__: 3-credits
* __Lectures and discussions__: Lecture at TuTh 9:05 AM - 9:55 AM in Kimball Hall B1 and Discussion at Tu and W 2:40 PM - 4:35 PM in Olin 245 or Hollister Hall 401.
* __Website__: Canvas and GitHub. Examples, labs, and other codes used throughout the course are available on our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/varnerlab/ENGRI-1120-IntroToChemE-Example-Notebooks.git](https://github.com/varnerlab/ENGRI-1120-IntroToChemE-Example-Notebooks.git).

### Topics
Lectures are organized into units, each having roughly four weeks of class time. Throughout the semester, we'll consider the following topics:

* [Unit 1: Systems, Surroundings, and Balance Equations](./chapter-1-dir/unit-1-introduction.md)
* [Unit 2: Phase Equilibrium in Chemical Engineering](./chapter-2-dir/chapter-2-intro.md)
* [Unit 3: Chemical Reaction Kinetics and Equlibrium](./chapter-3-dir/chapter-3-intro.md)

### Schedule
The lecture, lab, and problem set schedule can be viewed at (requires Cornell login): [https://cornell.box.com/s/j0a3qgmm3e77xrndp4zfttta78rk2h7f](https://cornell.box.com/s/j0a3qgmm3e77xrndp4zfttta78rk2h7f)

## Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. 

## Grading 
Each student’s final grade is individually determined at the end of the semester based on their performance in the following components (percentages subject to change):

| Percentage | Component |
| ----------: | --------- |
| 50%   | __Prelims__. There will be  2 x prelim exams (dates/times indicated on the course calendar). These exams are open to everything except each other. More on the specific topics of the prelims will follow. |
| 35%   | __Final group project__. Development of a research project by student groups (semester long with additional emphasis during the final five weeks of the course). The projects will conclude with a written report and a video presentation due near the end of the semester. The final written reports will be due on the University assigned date for final projects. |
| 15%   | __Participation__. Course participation (attending and interacting in lectures and discussions, questions, and TA/course evaluations) will be an important component of the course. Participation opportunities will be identified throughout the semester. |

### Grading details
* The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. The course is not graded on a curve. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not disadvantaged compared to those more comfortable.
* Remarkable effort and upward trending are considered, as is input from the teaching team.

### Problem sets and participation
This course will have optional weekly problem sets, which will be discussed in the discussion section(s) each week. Thus, while problem sets are optional (unless specified otherwise), we expect everyone to attempt every problem and to participate in the discussion section:

* The teaching team reserves the right to collect entire problem sets or specific questions of problem sets throughout the course. 
* Group work is welcome (and encouraged) on problem sets and course projects, but the prelim exams must be completed individually. 

## Course policies 
Scientists and engineers are responsible for maintaining a very high degree of professional integrity in their work. As a student, this means strictly adhering to the Cornell Code of Academic Integrity and the specific policies detailed in your courses.  Please review Cornell’s academic integrity policy if you are not already familiar with it. 

For this course, the specific rules are as follows:

* Cooperation: You may discuss/complete problem sets with classmates, but all submitted work (should there be any) must be your own. Prelims must be completed individually without the help of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and other sources. 

* Submissions: all required submissions (should there be any) must be submitted to the teaching team email. Each submission should include your name(s) or netID(s) on the first page of the assignment. Except for computer code, submissions should consist of a single PDF document generated using LaTeX. 

* Re-grade requests: Prelim re-grade requests must be submitted in writing within two weeks of their return. The entire prelim will be re-graded in addition to addressing any requested issues. 

* Computing: The course will officially support numerical computing in the Julia programming language. You can use other numerical computing tools (e.g., Matlab/Octave, Python/NumPy), but support will be limited to Julia. Julia is free and can be downloaded from: https://julialang.org.

* For any computing assignments, you may be required to publish code to GitHub or submit files to Gradescope; in these cases, specific instructions and procedures will be given.  

## Disabilities statement
If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, please provide Professor Varner with an accommodation letter from [Student Disability Services](https://sds.cornell.edu). Students are expected to give two weeks’ notice of the need for accommodations.  

## Diversity statement
We aspire to create an environment for learning, intellectual discourse, and professional and social interactions where everyone feels welcome and valued. We recognize all course participants as responsible adults with differing perspectives based partly on their unique experiences. [We espouse the broader mission and values of the Smith School](https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/cbe/about/mission).

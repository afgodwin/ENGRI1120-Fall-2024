# Introduction to Flux Balance Analysis and Metabolic Engineering

## Introduction

Metabolic engineering is the practice of optimizing genetic and regulatory processes within cells to increase the cell's production of a desired small molecule or macromolecule product, e.g., proteins of interest, and is a critical component of Biotechnology. There are (roughly) two categories of biotechnology: industrial and medical. Metabolic engineering plays a vital role in both sectors. Industrial biotechnology is typically consumer-focused, e.g., components of consumer products such as detergents, food products, and small-molecule chemical feedstocks. On the other hand, medical biotechnology develops molecules for human (and animal) health applications, e.g., antibodies, therapeutic proteins, vaccines, etc. 

The overall objective of a metabolic engineer is to maximize the `performance` of a metabolic network, e.g., develop a system that produces a desired product with the highest possible yield or at the maximum possible rate, etc. Toward this objective, metabolic engineers manipulate the biochemical networks cells use to convert raw materials into molecules necessary for the cell's survival. Metabolic engineering specifically seeks to:

1. Mathematically model biochemical networks, calculate the yield (product divided by substrate) of valuable products and identify parts of the network that constrain the production of these products of interest. 
1. Use genetic engineering techniques to modify the biochemical network to relieve constraints limiting production. Metabolic engineers can then model the modified network to calculate the new product yield and identify new constraints (back to 1).


Thus, a key component of metabolic engineering is the mathematical analysis of (bio)chemical reaction networks. Toward this challenge, we'll introduce a widely used tool to model and analyze reaction networks: flux balance analysis. In particular, this lecture will:

## Theory of Flux Balance Analysis 
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical modeling and analysis approach that estimates the _intracellular_ or _cell-free_ reaction rates (which are calles _fluxes_) throughout a _steady state_ reaction network (units: $\star$mol/volume-time). However, while we are introdcing flux balance analysis in the context of metbolic network nalaysis, FBA is a general tool that can be used to estimate _flows_ through many different types of networks and graphs, e.g., social graphs, communication networks, or other types of problems that can be represented as a network of graphs.  

Flux balance analysis is arguably the most widely used computational tool in metabolic engineering. However, there are alternatives to FBA, such as metabolic flux analysis (MFA), but these alternatives vary more in the solution approach than the structure of the estimation problem. 

(content:references:flux-balance-analysis-traditional-structure)=
### Traditional FBA problem structure
Suppose we have a system, which can be either open or closed, that has a species set $\mathcal{M}$ and a reaction set $\mathcal{R}$. Further suppose that the system (or at least part of it) is at or near steady-state. Then, the objective of the flux balance analysis is to estimate the value of the reaction rates operatering in the system using [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming).

````{prf:remark} What is linear programming?
:label: remark-lp
Linear programming (LP) is a method to estimate the best outcome (such as maximum profit, lowest cost, or the best possible rate of production) using a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships subject to linear constraints. 

[The development of the simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm), an efficient approach for solving linear programs, has led to LPs being used to solve problems in many engineering applications and other diverse industries such as banking, education, forestry, energy, and logistics. 
````

### Cannonical linear program
Linear programs maximize (or minimize) a _linear_ objective function $\mathcal{O}$ subject to _linear_ constraints and bounds on the variables we are searching over. 

Suppose we need to estimate some $M$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{x}$, e.g., the best possible allocation of some scarce resource such as cars to people in a ride-sharing application. Further, suppose that our problem can be represented as a system of linear equations. Then, we can estimate the _optimal_ value for the variables $\mathbf{x}$ by solving the linear program (canonical form):

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{maximize/minimize}~\mathcal{O} &=& \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i}x_{i}\\
\text{subject to}~\mathbf{Ax} &\leq&\mathbf{b}\\
\text{and}~x_{i}&\geq&{0}\qquad{i=1,2,\dots,M}
\end{eqnarray}
$$


The components of $\mathbf{x}$ are the variables to be determined, $c_{i}$ are constant coefficients in the _linear_ objective function $\mathcal{O}$,
$\mathbf{A}$ is a $N\times{M}$ matrix and $\mathbf{b}$ is a $N\times{1}$ (constant) vector. 

### Flux balance analysis as a linear program
The problem that are trying to solve when performing flux balance analysis is to estimate the vector of _unknown_ reaction rates in a metbaolic network such that some objective is maximized, e.g., the maximum rate of production subject to material balance and reaction bounds constraints. 

The flux balance analysis problem is typically encoded as a linear programming (LP) problem:

````{prf:definition} Flux balance analysis problem
:label: defn-fba-problem

Let a system consist of the species $\mathcal{M}$ and reactions $\mathcal{R}$. Further, let $v_{i}\in\mathcal{R}$ denote the value of reaction rate (flux) $i$ (units: mol/volume-time). Finally, we are interested in the steady-state value for the unknown reaction rates. 

Then, the flux balance analysis problem, whose solution provides estimates for the values of the unknown fluxes inside the steady-state system, is a linear programming problem that maximizes (minimizes) the objective function:

```{math}
\text{maximize/minimze}~\mathcal{O}=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{R}}c_{i}v_{i}
```

subject to the linear constraints:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v} &=& \mathbf{0}\\
\mathcal{L}\leq&\mathbf{v}&\leq\mathcal{U}\\
\dots &=& \dots
\end{eqnarray}$$

The matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is the $\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{R}$ stoichiometric matrix, $c_{i}$ denote the objective coefficients, 
$\mathbf{v}$ denotes the unkown flux vector (the unknown that we are trying to estimate), and 
$\mathcal{L}$ ($\mathcal{U}$) denote the permissible lower (upper) bounds on the _unknown_ fluxes. 
````

The first set of constraints in {prf:ref}`defn-fba-problem` are material constraints, while the second imparts thermodynamic and kinetic information into the calculation. Finally, there are potentially other types of constraints (both linear and nonlinear) not shown in {prf:ref}`defn-fba-problem` that may be necessary for specific applications encountered in practice.

(content:references:flux-balance-analysis-alternative-structure)=
### Alternative approach
The standard flux balance analysis problem is written in `concentration` units, e.g., the metabolic reaction flux has units of $\star$mol/volume-time. However, there is nothing that says we have to do that. For example, it may be more convenient to work in mole units instead. In this case, we estimate the unknown open reaction extent instead of calculating the unknown reaction rate. 

#### Mole-based problem formulation
We know from our [earlier discussion of material balances](../chapter-1-dir/material-balances.md) that the open species mole balance around component $i$ in a steady-state system with species $\mathcal{M}$, streams $\mathcal{S}$ and reactions $\mathcal{R}$ is given by:

$$\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}v_{s}\dot{n}_{si} + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{j} = 0\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}$$

If we don't have [kinetic rate laws](./chemical-kinetics.md), or we are not approaching this problem from the [equilibrium or energy perspective](./chemical-equilibrium.md), then we need some other way to estimate the extent of reaction $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$. 

````{prf:observation} Mole based problem formulation
:label: obs-simple-mole-based case
Suppose we have an open steady-state system with species $\mathcal{M}$, streams $\mathcal{S}$ and reactions $\mathcal{R}$, but we have only a single stream entering (s = 1) and exiting (s = 2) the system. Further, suppose we want to maximize/minimize an objective of the form:

```{math}
\text{maximize/minimze}~\mathcal{O}=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{R}}c_{i}\dot{\epsilon}_{i}
```

In other words, we want to estimate the open extent such that some _technological_ objective is met, e.g., we maximize the production of a valuable product. For the case of a single input and output, the open mole balance becomes:

$$\dot{n}_{2,i} = \dot{n}_{1,i} + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{j}\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}$$

Of course, when searching for the optimal set of reaction extents $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$ we have to select values that give physically realistic answers, e.g., we can't have a negative mole flow rates: $\dot{n}_{i,j}\geq{0}$ for all $i$ and $j$. Thus, the species mole balances (which are linear) are constraints that make sure we select physically realistic values for the optimal open extent: 

$$\dot{n}_{1,i} + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{j}\geq{0}\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}$$

Next, the $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$ terms, like concentration-based flux, must be bounded, i.e., we can't have infinite values for the open reaction extent, nor can irreversible reactions be chosen to run backward. Thus, the extents are _bounded_ from above and below:

$$\mathcal{L}_{j}\leq\dot{\epsilon}_{j}\leq\mathcal{U}_{j}\qquad{j=1,2\dots,\mathcal{R}}$$

The $\mathcal{L}_{j}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{j}$ denote the lower and upper bounds that $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$ can take. Open extents $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$ are just reaction rates times the volume; the lower and upper bounds describe the permissible range we expect the rate _could_ take.

````

Putting these ideas together for the general case of multiple input and output streams gives a different problem formulation to compute the flux through a reaction network using mole based units:

````{prf:definition} Mole based flux problem
:label: defn-mol-based-units

Suppose we have an open system with species $\mathcal{M}$, streams $\mathcal{S}$ and reactions $\mathcal{R}$. Further, suppose we partition the stream set $\mathcal{S}$ into streams entering the system $\mathcal{S}^{+}$, and streams leaving the system $\mathcal{S}^{-}$. 

Then, the steady-state species mole balances are given by:

```{math}
\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}^{+}}\dot{n}_{si} - \sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}^{-}}\dot{n}_{ki} + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{j} = 0\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}
```

Finally, we know that $\dot{n}_{i,j}\geq{0}$ for every $i$ and $j$; species mole flows must be non-negative. Then, the (unknown) open extents $\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$ are the solution of a linear programming problem in which the linear objective $\mathcal{O}$:

$$\text{maximize/minimize}~\mathcal{O} = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}c_{j}\dot{\epsilon}_{j}$$

is minimized (or maximized) subject to a collection of linear constraints:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{j\in\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\dot{\epsilon}_{j}&\geq&{-\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}^{+}}\dot{n}_{si}}\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}\\
\sum_{k\in\mathcal{S}^{-}}\dot{n}_{ki}&\geq&{0}\qquad\forall{i}\in\mathcal{M}\\
\mathcal{L}_{j}&\leq\dot{\epsilon}_{j}\leq&\mathcal{U}_{j}\qquad\forall{j}\in\mathcal{R}
\end{eqnarray}$$

#### Convex pathway analysis (advanced topic)
The stoichiometric matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is a $\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{R}$ array holding the 
coefficients $\sigma_{ij}$; each row of $\mathbf{S}$ describes a metabolite, while each column represents a possible chemical reaction. Thus, the stoichiometric matrix is a _digital_ representation of the biochemical capabilities of a metabolic network. 

When formulating the stoichiometric matrix, what should be included to describe known or unknown desired phenomena? For example, suppose we are interested in producing product $P$ or making sense of a metabolic data set. Should every possible reaction or just some _subset_ of all possible reactions be included in the stoichiometric matrix? The practical significance of this question is two-fold:

* Fewer material balances are better when describing the behavior of a metabolic network, and
* Fewer chemical reactions (fluxes) result in less uncertainty when estimating the kinetic rates $\hat{r}_{j}$ (bounds) or other constraints.

Convex pathway analysis is an approach to catalog all possible steady-state pathways through a reaction network. In particular, convex decomposition approaches posit that any potential steady-state flux can be represented as the [convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination) of a set of [convex independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_position) basis vectors called _extreme pathways_ $\mathbf{P}_{i}$:

$$\mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{P}}\alpha_{i}\mathbf{P}_{i}$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the number of basis pathways, and $\mathbf{P}_{i}$ denotes the $\mathcal{R}\times{1}$ extreme pathway basis vector. The term(s) $\alpha_{i}\geq{0}$ denotes the weight of extreme pathway $i$. 

Extreme pathways are _very difficult_ to compute but can give super exciting insights into the operation and capabilities of a metabolic network.

## Summary
This lecture introduced metabolic engineering and tools such as flux balance analysis to estimate the reaction rate through a (bio)chemical reaction network.

Flux balance analysis, written in either concentration or mole-based forms, is a linear programming problem in which the values for the unknown reaction rates or open reaction extents (which we collectively called _fluxes_) are estimated by minimizing (maximizing) the sum of the unknown fluxes subject to physical conservation constraints and constraints on the permissible values that the flux can take.  While the material we introduced was in the context of estimating unknown reaction rates, the ideas that underly flux balance analysis are more general; these same principles are used in various applications in many disciplines.
